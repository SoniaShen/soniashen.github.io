Two dimensional array list
web link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10866205/two-dimensional-array-list
i.e.
    List<List<String>> listOfLists = new ArrayList<List<String>>();


java中list存储有顺序吗:
list是有顺序的,hashset是无序的,treeset是有序的


How to empty or clear ArrayList in Java:
web link: https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/arraylist/empty-clear-arraylist/
i.e.    Difference between clear() vs removeAll() methods

By going through the sourcecode of both methods, we can safely say that clear() method give much better performance because of less number of statements it executes.

removeAll() method lack in performance because of extra call to contains() method.
But, still removeAll() method is useful in cases such as merge two arraylists without duplicate elements.



ArrayList vs. LinkedList
web link: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_linkedlist.asp

i.e.
It is best to use an ArrayList when:
    You want to access random items frequently
    You only need to add or remove elements at the end of the list

It is best to use a LinkedList when:
    You only use the list by looping through it instead of accessing random items
    You frequently need to add and remove items from the beginning or middle of the list
