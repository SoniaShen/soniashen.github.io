--------
ASCII:

American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is the most common format for text files in computers and on the Internet.

In an ASCII file, each alphabetic, numeric, or special character is represented with a 7-bit binary number. 128 possible character are defined.

----
    - UNIX and DOS-based operating systems use "ASCII" for text files.

    - Windows NT and 2000 uses a newer code, "Unicode".

    - IBM's S/390 systems use a proprietary 8-bit code called "EBCDIC".

Conversion programs allow different operating systems to change a file from one code to another.

----
ASCII was developed by the American National Standard Institue (ANSI).

Unicode:

Unicode is an entirely new idea in setting up biniary codes for text or script characters. Officially called the Unicode Worlswide Character Standard.

The Unicode standard is a system for "the interchange, processing, and display of the written texts of the diverse (very different) languages of the modern world". It also supports many classical and history texts in a number of languages.

----
Currently, the Unicode standard contains 34,168 distinct coded  characters derived from 24 supported language scripts. These characters cover the principal written languages of the world.

Additional work is underway to add the few morden languages not yet included.
