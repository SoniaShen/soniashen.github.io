--------
Network socket:

A network socket is one endpoint in a communication flow between two programs running over a network.

    - Sockets are created and used with a set of programming requests, or "function calls" sometimes called the "Sockets Application Programming Interface (API)". The most common sockets API is the Berkeley UNIX C interface for sockets.

    - Sockets can also be used for communication between processes within the same computer.

----
This is the typical sequence of "sockets requests" from a "server application" in the "connectionless context of the Internet", in which a server handles many client requests and dose not maintain a connection longer than the serving of the immediate request:
    - socket() request;
    - bind() request;
    - recvfrom() request;
    - Wait for a sendto() request from some client;
    - Process the sendto() request from the client;
    - sendto() in reply to the request from the client, for example, send an HTML file.

A corresponding client sequence of sockets requests would be:
    - socket();
    - bind();
    - sendto();
    - recvfrom();
----

    - Sockets can also be used for "connection-oriented" transactions (business) with somewhat different sequence of "C language system calls/functions".


--------
Secure "Socket" Layer:

The SSL is a computer networking protocol that manages:
    - server authentication;
    - client authentication;
    - encrypted communication between servers and clients.
