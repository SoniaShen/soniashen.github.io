--------
In a Local Area Network (LAN) or other netwrok, the Media Access Control (MAC) address ia your computer's unique hardware number.

On an Ethernet LAN, MAC address is the same as the Ethernet address.

When you are connected to the Internet from your computer (i.e. or host as the Internet Protocol thinks of it), a "correspondence table" relates your IP address to your computer's physical MAC address on the LAN.


----
The MAC address is used by the Media Access Control sublayer of the Data-Link Layer (DLC) of telecommunication protocols.

There is a different MAC sublayer for each physical device type.

The other sublayer level in the Data-Link Layer (DLC) is the Logical Link Control sublayer.

Definition:

A MAC address is a unique identifier for an Ethernet or network adapter over a netwrok. It distinguishes different netwrok interfaces, and is used for a number of netowrk technologies, particularly most IEEE 802 networks, including Ethernet.

In the OSI model, MAC address is occur in the Media Access Control Protocol sublayer.

A MAC address is also known as physical address, hardware address, and burned-in address.

----
Techopedia Expains:

MAC addresses are generally assigned by the vendor/manufacturer of every Network Interface Card (NIC) developed. They are implemented in most network types, but unlike IP adderss, MAC addresses are permanent and can't be changed.

A MAC address is created using the specifications provided by IEEE. Each MAC address consists of a 12-digit hexadecimal notation, which is embedded within the Network Interface Card (NIC) firmware, and is composed of a 6-digit manufacturer's organization unique identifier followed by a 6-digit serialized/random unique identifier.

Example MAC address of my virtualbox:
    - HWaddr 08:00:27:fd:78:3b
