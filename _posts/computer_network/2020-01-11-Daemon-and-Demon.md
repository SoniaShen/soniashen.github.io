--------
Deamon:

A daemon is a program that runs continuously and exists for the purpose of handling periodic service requests that a computer system expects to receive.

----
The "daemon" program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate.

----
Each server of pages on the Web has an "HTTPD" (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon) that continually waits for requests to come in from Web clients and their users.

Demon:

A demon (also see "daemon" which has a somewhat similar meaning), is a program or process, which is part of a larger program or process.

A "demon" is dormant (sleeping) until a certain condition occurs, and then is initiated to do its processing.

----
First example:

An AI (artificial intelligence) program might include a number of "demons", one or more of which might become active when a new piece of knowledge was acquired by the AI program.

If the new knowledge affected a partucular demon's owm sphere of knowledge, it would spring into action and create new pieces of knowledge based on its particular inference rules.

Each of these new pieces of knowledge might in turn activate additional demons, that would continue to filter through and refine the entire AI knowledge base.

----
Second example:

A second example pf a "demon" may be found in personal computer help systems, games, or any application.

When a program so determines by the the state of the user interactions with the program, a "popup" window and program is introduced to the user for help, for a clue, or for a small calculation.
