--------
Anchor:

In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), an "anchor" is the establishing of:
    - a term;
    - a phrase;
    - an image;
or other information object as being either:
    - The target of a "hypertext link" within a document; or
    - A reference (a link you can select, instead of a hypertext link) to such a target.

----
Note that any HTML file name is automatically an "anchor" or "target" that can be linked to.

An "anchor" Within a file, to which you can link directly, is identified by the "#" sign followed by the name.
