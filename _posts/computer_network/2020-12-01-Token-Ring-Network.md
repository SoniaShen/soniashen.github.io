--------
A token ring network is a local area network (LAN) in which all computers are connected in a RING or STAR topoligy, and pass one or more logical tokens from host to host.

Only a host that holds a token can send data, and tokens are released when receipt of the data is confirmed.

Token Ring networks prevent data packets from colliding on a network segment, because data can only be sent by a token holder and the number of tokens available is controlled.

--------
The most broadly deployed Token Ring Protocol were IBM's, released in the mid-1980s, and the standardized version of it known as IEEE 802.5, which appeared in the late 1980s. The IEEE standard version provides for data transfer rates of 4, 16, or 100 Mbps.
