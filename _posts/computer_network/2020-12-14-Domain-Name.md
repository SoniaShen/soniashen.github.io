--------
A domain name locates an Organization or other entity on the Internet.

--------
For example, the Domain Name "www.totalbaseball.com" locates an Internet address for "totalbaseball.com" at Internet Point "199.0.0.2" and a particular host server named "www".

The "com" part of the domain name reflects the purpose of the organization or entity (in this example, "commercial"); and is called the Top-level Domain name.

Top-level Domian (TLD)
[web link: https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/top-level-domain-TLD]

A top-level domain (TLD) is the last segment of the Domain name.

The top-level domain is the letters immediately following the final dot in an Internet Address.

----
A top-level domain identifies something about the website assosiated with it, such as its purpose, the organization that owns it, or the geographical area where it originates.

Each top-level domain has a seperate Registry managed by a designated organization under the direction of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

In our Internet Address, https://whatis.techtarget.com: 
    - com is the top-level domain name;
    - techtarget.com is the second-level domain name;
    - whatis is a subdomain name.
All together, these constitute a Fully-qualified Domain Name (FQDN);
the addition of HTTP:// makes an fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) a complete URL.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
[web link: https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/URL]

A uniform resource locator (URL) is an uniqie identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address.

Uniform Resource Locatior (URLs) consists of multiple parts -- include a Protocol and Domain Name -- that tells a Web Browser how and where to retrive a resource.

End Users are URLs by typing them directly into the Address Bar of a Browser or by clicking a Hyperlink fond on a Webpage, bookmark list, in an e-mail, or form another application.

Back to TLD:

ICANN identifies the following categories of Top-Level Domains (TLDs):

    - Country-Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLD):
      Each ccTLD identifies a particular country and is two letters long.
      The ccTLD for the United States, for example, is us.

    - Infranstructure Top-Level Domain:
      There is only one TLD in this group, i.e. Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA).
      The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages this TLD for the IEFE (Internet Engineering Task Force).

    - Sponsored Top-Level Domains (sTLD):
      These are overseen by private organizations.

    - Generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD):
      These are the most common and familiar TLDs.
      Examples include "com" for "commerical" and "edu" for "educational".
      Most gTLDs are open for registration by anyone, but there is also a subgroup that is more strictly controlled.

----
In April 2009, ICANN proposed an expansion of the TLD system to allow anyone to register and reserve any unused letter sequenve as a Top-Level Domain (TLD) for their exclusive use. A company that sold software, for example, might like to use ".soft" as a TLD. According to ICANN chief executive Pual Levins, such an expansion could lead to thousands of new TLDs in the next few years.

Back to Domain Name:

Example Domain Name: www.totalbaseball.com

The "totalbaseball" part of the domain name defines the organization or entity and together with the Top-Level is called Second-Level Domain Name (SLD). The Second-Level Domain Name maps to and can be thought of as the "readable" version of the Internet Address.

Second-Level Domain (SLD) names must be unique on the Internet, and registered WITH one of the ICANN-accredited registras for the COM, NET, and ORG top-level domains. Where appropriate, a top-level domain name can be geographic.

Currently, most non-U.S. domain names use a top-level domain name based on the country the server is in. To register a U.S. geographic domain name or a domain name under a country code, see an appropriate registrar.

-------
A third level can be defined to identity a particular Host Server at the Internet Address.

In our example, "www" is the name of the server that handles Internet requests. (A second server might called "www2.")

A third level of domain name is not required. For example, the Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) could have been "totalbaseball.com" and the server assumed.

--------
Subdomain levels can be used. For example, "nyyankees".

For example, you could have "www.nyyankees.totalbaseball.com". Together, they constitutes a Fully-Qualified Domain Name.

--------
On the Web, the domain name is that part of the Uniform Resource Locatior (URL) -- domain name plus "https://" part -- that tells a domain name server (i.e. www) using the Domaiin Name System (DNS) whether or where to forward a request for a Web Page. 

====
Domian Name System (DNS):
[web link: https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/domain-name-system]

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a naming database in which Internet domain names are located and translated into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 

The Domain Name System (DNS) maps the name people use to locate a Website to the IP addresses that a computer uses to locate a website. (Both can locate a Website).

For example, if someone types "example.com" into a Web Browser, a server behind the scenes will map that name to the corresponding IP address, something similar in structure to 121.12.12.121.

----
Web browsing and most other Internet activities rely on Domain Name System (DNS) to quickly provide the information necessary to connect users to remote hosts.

Domain Name System (DNS) mapping is distributed throughout the Internet in a hierarchy of authority.

----
Access provider and enterprise, as well as governments, universities and other organizations, typically have their own assigned ranges of IP (Internet Protocol) Addresses and an assigned Domain Name. They also typically run DNS (Domain Name System) servers to manage the mapping of those names to those addresses. Most URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are built around the Domain Name of the Web Server that takes Client Requsts.

====
Back to Domain Name Part:

The domain name is mapped to an IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) which represents a physical point on the Internet. More than one Domain Name can be mapped to the same Internet Address. This allows multiple individuals, businesses, and organizations to have separate Internet Identities while sharing the same Internet Server.

--------
It may be worth nothing that the Domain Name System (DNS) contains even higher level of Domain than the Top-Level Domain (TLP).

The highest level is the "root domain", which would be represented by "a single dot" if it were ever used. (just as in many hierarchical file systems, a "root directory" is represented by a "/").

If the dot for the root domain were shown in the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it would be to the right of the Top-Level Domain (TLD) Name. However, the dot is assumed to be there, but never shown.

--------
To see the IP Address for a Domian Name, Ping.
