--------
Port Address Translation (PAT), is an extension to NAT that permits multiple devices on a Local Area Network (LAN) to be mapped to a single public IP address.

The goal of PAT is to conserve (protect/sover/shield) IP addresses.

----
Most home networks use PAT. In such scenario, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns a single IP address to the home network's router.

When "Computer X" logs on the Internet, the router assigns the client a port number, which is appended to the internal IP address. This, in effect, gives "Computer X" a unique address. If "Computer Z" logs on the Internet at the same time, the router assigns it the same local IP address with a different port number.

Although both computers are sharing the same public IP address and accessing the Internet at the same time, the router kmows exactly which computer to send specific packets to because each computer has a unique internal address.

----
PAT is also called porting, port overloading, port-level multiplexed NAT, single address NAT.
