--------
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an error-reporting protocol, network devices like routers use it to generate error messages to the source IP address when network problems prevent delivery of IP packets.

----
ICMP creates and sends messages to the source IP address indicating that a gateway to the Internet (i.e. a router/service/host) cannot be reached for packet delivery.

----
Any IP network device has the capability to send/receive/process ICMP messages.


--------
ICMP is not a "transport" protocol that sends data between systems.

While ICMP is not used regularly in end-user applications, it is used by network administrators to troubleshoot Internet connections in "diagnostic utilities" (e.g. "ping" and "traceroute").

----
One of the main protocols of the IP suit, ICMP is used by routers/intermediary devices/hosts to communicate error information/updates to other routers/intermediary devices/hosts.

The widely used IPv4 and the newer IPv6 use similar versions of the ICMP protocol (i.e. ICMPv4 and ICMPv6).

    - ICMP messages are transmitted as datagrams, and consist of an IP header that encapsulates the ICMP data.
    - ICMP packets are IP packets with ICMP in the IP data protion.
    - ICMP messages also contain the entire IP header from the original message, so the end system knows which packet failed.


--------
The ICMP header appears after the IPv4/IPv6 packet header, and is identified as IP protocol number 1.

The complex protocl contains three field:
    - The major "TYPE" that identifies the ICMP message;
    - The minor "CODE" that contains more info about the type filed;
    - The "CHECKSUM" that helps detect errors introduced during transmission.

Following the three fileds in the ICMP and the original IP header to identify which packets actually failed.

The chart below shows a listing of the defined types and their descriptions:
+-----------+--------------------------+
| ICMP type | ICMP description         |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 0         | Echo reply.              |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 3         | Destination unreachable. |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 4         | Source quench.           |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 5         | Redirect message.        |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 8         | Echo request.            |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 11        | Time exceeded.           |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 12        | Parameter problem.       |
+-----------+--------------------------+
| 13        | Timestamp request.       |

| 18        | Address mask reply.      |

----
ICMP has been used to execute "Denial-of-Service" attacks, also called the "Ping to Death", by sending an IP packet larger than the number of bytes allowed by the IP protocol.

[web link: https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/denial-of-service]
The ping-of-death attack abused the ping protocol by sending request messages with oversized payloads, causing targeted system to become overwhelmed, to stop responding to legitimate requests for service and to possibly crash the victim's systems.
